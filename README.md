# my-custom-xmonad
My custom xmonad scripts, free for anyone to use!!

# Dependencies :

  This Config uses tint2 panel so keep that handy
  
  
  
  I used alacritty as my default terminal emulator so have alacrity on you
  
  
  Keep nitrogen as well for setting the wallpaper etc
  
  
  if you are on arch/gentoo or something of that sort you probably need to install firefox
  
  
  i aslo have a shortcut built in for brave browser although that can be removed through simply editting the config
  
  
  
Note: if the first thing you see is a black screen do not worry! The panel will take a few seconds to load and at first boot there is no wallpaper
